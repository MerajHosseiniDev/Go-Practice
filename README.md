# ðŸ§  Code Practice Repository

Hi, I'm Meraj â€” a self-taught developer on a focused journey to become a professional **backend engineer** using **Go (Golang)**.  
This repository is where I document my progress, practice key concepts, and build the foundation for real-world development.

## ðŸš€ About This Repository

This is a personal space where I regularly upload:
- Hands-on exercises
- Concept experiments
- Small projects
- Notes and code snippets

Itâ€™s not polished production code â€” itâ€™s a reflection of my learning process and continuous improvement.

## ðŸŽ¯ My Learning Path

I started programming after finishing military service, choosing not to go to university.  
Instead, I committed to learning programming from scratch â€” especially **Go**, which I now use as my main language.

I follow the [Golang roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/golang) and have already covered:
- Core data types (int, float, string, bool, rune, byte)
- Control flow (if, for, switch)
- Slices, arrays, maps, structs, functions
- Modules, packages, and pointers
- Concurrency (goroutines, buffered channels)

## ðŸ“Œ Goals

- Become fluent and confident in backend development using Go
- Build strong problem-solving and system design skills
- Create real-world projects and gain professional experience

## ðŸ™Œ Notes

- Everything here is written and organized by me, with full transparency about what I'm learning.
- Suggestions, feedback, or contributions are welcome if you're on a similar journey.

**Thanks for visiting â€” and happy coding! ðŸš€**
